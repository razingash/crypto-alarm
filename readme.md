### About

- Users can create their own expressions. Custom keyboard includes fractions,
powers up, roots and modules. Trigonometric functions will never be supported.

- All cryptocurrencies supported by all available Binance endpoints are accessible â€” over 3000 in total.
This covers approximately 99.8% of all cryptocurrencies on Binance, excluding only the newest ones not yet fully integrated across all endpoints.

- All variables from all significant endpoints, such as /v3/ticker/24hr, /v3/ticker/price, etc. are available. There is currently no access to websockets

- If for some reason Binance stops supporting cryptocurrencies or variables received from specific APIs,
system will block access to these data and deactivates all related formulas and variables
